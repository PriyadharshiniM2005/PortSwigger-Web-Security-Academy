# PortSwigger Web Security Academy – Learning Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on learning and practical experience gained through the **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.  
The academy provides industry-recognized labs designed to simulate real-world web application vulnerabilities in a safe and authorized environment.

Through these labs, I developed a strong foundation in identifying, understanding, and exploiting common web security vulnerabilities, while also learning appropriate mitigation and secure coding practices.

## Key Learning Areas

### SQL Injection
Gained practical experience in understanding how insecure database queries can lead to authentication bypass, sensitive data disclosure, and full database compromise. The labs emphasized the importance of input validation and parameterized queries.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Learned how reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities occur due to improper handling of user input. The labs demonstrated how attackers can execute malicious scripts in a victim’s browser and how proper encoding and sanitization prevent such attacks.

### Clickjacking
Understood how UI redressing attacks can trick users into performing unintended actions. The labs highlighted the risks of missing frame protection and how clickjacking can be combined with other vulnerabilities.

### DOM-Based Vulnerabilities
Developed a strong understanding of client-side security issues caused by unsafe JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Learned how trusting user-controlled data on the client side can introduce serious security risks.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Learned how misconfigured CORS policies can expose sensitive data across origins. The labs focused on identifying insecure trust relationships and improper origin validation.

### OS Command Injection
Understood how passing untrusted input to system commands can result in remote command execution. The labs demonstrated both direct and blind command injection scenarios.

### Path Traversal
Learned how attackers can manipulate file paths to access unauthorized files. The labs covered common bypass techniques and the importance of strict path validation.

### Access Control Vulnerabilities
Gained insight into how improper authorization checks can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized data access. The labs emphasized enforcing access control on the server side.

### Insecure Deserialization
Learned how trusting serialized user data can allow attackers to manipulate application behavior. The labs highlighted risks associated with insecure deserialization and the need for strict validation.
