Path Traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths.

### Labs Solved
- File path traversal, simple case
- Absolute path bypass
- Non-recursive traversal stripping bypass
- URL decoding bypass
- Validation of file extension with null byte injection
